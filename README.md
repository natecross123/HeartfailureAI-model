# HeartfailureAI-model

Heart Failure Prediction
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates a machine learning workflow for predicting heart failure. The project utilizes a dataset from a Kaggle competition to build and evaluate different models.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various patient attributes. The notebook covers the following steps:

Data Loading: Loading the training and test datasets.
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and encoding categorical features.
Model Training: Training a Logistic Regression, a simple Neural Network, and a Random Forest Classifier.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of each model using accuracy score.
Prediction and Submission: Making predictions on the test set and generating a submission file in the specified format for the Kaggle competition.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from the "Heart Failure Prediction COMP3220 Summer 2025" Kaggle competition. It includes various health metrics and patient information. The dataset is split into heart_train.csv and heart_test.csv.

Dependencies
The project requires the following libraries:

pandas
scikit-learn
tensorflow
kaggle
